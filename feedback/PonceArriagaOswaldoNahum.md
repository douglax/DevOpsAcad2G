## My course review

I had a little knowledge about some commandlines in linux but I think whitin this course I could learn more about it. 
Perhaps, I didnt know anything about linux process (start, stop, restart), how create users or how scripting works, so this facts turn so interesting the way how I am learning right now.
I liked the way how Alejandro taught us even though he had been fast but I really undestood all the topics he explained us.

### What I learnt
- Linux CommandLine
- Git 
- Create branches with Git
- Start and stop process on Linux
- Create Users 
- Run bash scripts
- Run an Apache server
- Generate and use ssh
- Connecting from workspace to server machine

Thanks!
